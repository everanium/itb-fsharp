/// Pump loop. The Go harness hands ITB an io.Reader / io.Writer pair
/// and ITB drives the chunk loop internally; the C ABI has no reader /
/// writer entry, so the caller drives it: open a session, feed slices of
/// at most 1 MiB, drain whatever the session has produced after every
/// write (a read before end never blocks), end, then drain until the
/// session reports finished (after end, a read on an empty spool blocks
/// until the terminal bytes arrive). The whole produced output lands in
/// the worker's reusable accumulator. The loop is written here rather
/// than delegated to the binding's pump convenience so it stands in the
/// utility, at the same place, in every language. On failure the result
/// names the failing call and carries its error.
